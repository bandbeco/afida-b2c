A practical guide to improving Afida's cold outreach emails.

## Part 1: Real Email Reviews

This section analyses actual emails and shows how to improve them.

### Email #1: The Short Template

**The Original:**

> Hi Laurent
>
> I'm Tariq from Afida.
>
> We supply a variety of eco-friendly products to bars, restaurants and hotels within the UK.
>
> One product in particular we have just brought to market is a Bamboo Fibre Straw.
>
> Our Bamboo Fibre Straws provide the same convenience and functionality as plastic whilst being entirely biodegradable.
>
> Colour = Natural Bamboo & Black
>
> Would you like a free sample?
>
> Please find our brochure attached for more info on the straws and all other products.
>
> Kind Regards,
> Tariq

**Issues Identified:**

| Problem | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **No personalisation** | Reads like a template - easy to ignore |
| **Weak opening** | "I'm Tariq from Afida" focuses on you, not them |
| **No urgency** | No reason to respond today vs. never |
| **Features, not benefits** | "Same as plastic" - so what? How does it help them? |
| **Passive CTA** | "Would you like...?" is easy to say no to |
| **Dated phrasing** | "Please find attached" feels formal and impersonal |
| **Attachments** | Often trigger spam filters in cold emails |
| **Random formatting** | "Colour = Natural Bamboo & Black" feels like a spec sheet |

**Rewritten Version:**

> Hi [First Name],
>
> With the plastic straw ban now in effect, I'm guessing you've tried paper straws - and heard the complaints about them going soggy.
>
> We've just launched Bamboo Fibre Straws that solve this. They're fully biodegradable but don't disintegrate in drinks like paper does. Several [city] bars have already switched.
>
> I'd love to send you a free sample pack to try - just reply with your address and I'll get it posted tomorrow.
>
> Cheers,
> Tariq

### Email #2: The Kitchen Sink

**The Original:**

> Hi Laurent
>
> I hope you're well!
>
> I wanted to introduce you to Afida - we specialise in eco-friendly packaging that doesn't compromise on performance, design, or sustainability.
>
> We're excited to share our brand new Bio-Fibre Straw, a revolutionary alternative to traditional paper and plastic. It's stronger, lasts longer in drinks, and is 100% compostable. It's a true game-changer for environmentally conscious brands — and we'd love to send you a free sample to try for yourself.
>
> In addition to straws, we also supply a wide range of custom-branded and unbranded sustainable packaging, including:
>
> - Coffee cups
> - Food containers
> - Napkins
> - Paper bags
> - Pizza boxes
> - And more
>
> We offer competitive wholesale pricing, flexible MOQs, and in-house design support to help bring your packaging to life.
>
> If you're interested, I'd be happy to provide a tailored quote or send over some visuals of our work with other brands.
>
> Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
>
> Kind Regards,
> Tariq

**Issues Identified:**

| Problem | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Way too long** | ~180 words - should be under 100. Won't get read on mobile |
| **"I hope you're well"** | Filler that signals template email |
| **"Revolutionary" / "Game-changer"** | Overused marketing-speak that triggers scepticism |
| **Product list mid-email** | Makes it feel like a catalogue, not a conversation |
| **No personalisation** | Nothing specific to the recipient |
| **Weak ending** | "Looking forward to hearing your thoughts" is passive and vague |
| **Multiple CTAs** | Quote OR visuals - pick one |
| **Excessive line breaks** | Makes it look unprofessional |

**The Core Problem:**

This email tries to say EVERYTHING in one go. This comes from fear of missing an opportunity, but it backfires:

| Tariq's Instinct | Reality |
|------------------|---------|
| "If I mention all our products, they'll find something they need" | They'll skim and forget |
| "More information = more professional" | More information = less likely to read |
| "I should explain everything upfront" | First email's only job is to get a reply |

**Side-by-Side Comparison:**

| Original (~180 words) | Rewritten (~65 words) |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Hi Laurent | Hi Laurent, |
| I hope you're well! | |
| I wanted to introduce you to Afida... | Our Bio-Fibre Straws outlast paper by 3x and compost in 90 days - customers get a better experience, you stay sustainable. |
| [Long paragraph about straws] | |
| [Product list] | We also do cups, containers, and custom-branded packaging if you ever need a one-stop supplier. |
| [Services paragraph] | |
| If you're interested... | Can I send you a free sample pack to try? |
| Looking forward to hearing... | |
| Kind Regards, Tariq | Cheers, Tariq |
| | PS - Happy to share examples of branding work we've done for other [bars/restaurants/hotels] too. |

**Words to Avoid:**

These trigger scepticism - let the product speak for itself instead:

- ❌ Revolutionary
- ❌ Game-changer
- ❌ Excited to share
- ❌ Cutting-edge
- ❌ Best-in-class
- ❌ Innovative solution

**Better approach:** Use specific claims like "outlasts paper by 3x" or "composts in 90 days"

---

### Pattern Across Both Emails

Both emails share the same core issues:

| Issue | Email #1 | Email #2 |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Too long | ✗ Borderline | ✗ Way too long |
| No personalisation | ✗ | ✗ |
| Features over benefits | ✗ | ✗ |
| Passive CTAs | ✗ | ✗ |
| Trying to do too much | ✗ | ✗ |

**The fix:** Pick ONE product (straws) and ONE offer (free samples) for initial outreach. Everything else comes in follow-ups.

---

## Part 2: Key Principles for Cold Outreach

### The Golden Rules

1. **Lead with their problem, not your product**
   - Bad: "We make eco-friendly straws"
   - Good: "Tired of customers complaining about soggy paper straws?"

2. **Personalise every email**
   - Mention their venue name
   - Reference something specific about their business
   - Show you've done your homework

3. **Keep it short**
   - Under 100 words ideal
   - 3-5 sentences max
   - Mobile-friendly (most people read on phones)

4. **One clear call-to-action**
   - Don't ask them to read a brochure AND request samples AND visit your website
   - Pick one thing you want them to do

5. **Make the CTA easy**
   - Bad: "Would you like a sample?"
   - Good: "Reply with your address and I'll post samples tomorrow"

6. **Follow up**
   - Most responses come from follow-ups, not the first email
   - 3-4 follow-ups is normal and expected
   - Space them 3-7 days apart

## Part 3: Email Templates

### Version A: Problem-Agitation-Solution

**Subject:** The soggy straw problem

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Paper straws look great on an Instagram post. Less great when they're collapsing into a customer's G&T.
>
> We've just launched Bamboo Fibre Straws - they're fully biodegradable but hold up like plastic. No sogginess, no complaints.
>
> Can I send you a free sample pack to try?
>
> Cheers,
> Tariq

**Best for:** Venues you know use paper straws currently.

---

### Version B: Social Proof Lead

**Subject:** What [Local Area] bars are switching to

> Hi [First Name],
>
> A few [Manchester/London/etc.] venues have asked us the same thing recently: "Is there an eco straw that doesn't go soggy?"
>
> Our Bamboo Fibre Straws are the answer - biodegradable but with the durability of plastic.
>
> Happy to send a free sample if you'd like to try them?
>
> Tariq

**Best for:** When you have existing customers in their area to reference.

---

### Version C: Direct & Ultra-Short

**Subject:** Free straw samples for [Venue Name]

> Hi [First Name],
>
> We make biodegradable straws that don't go soggy.
>
> Can I send you a free sample pack?
>
> Tariq
> Afida

**Best for:** Busy decision-makers who prefer brevity.

---

### Version D: Regulation Angle

**Subject:** Quick question about your straws

> Hi [First Name],
>
> With single-use plastic straws now banned, most venues have switched to paper - and most customers hate them.
>
> Our Bamboo Fibre Straws are fully compliant, biodegradable, and don't disintegrate mid-drink.
>
> Worth trying a free sample?
>
> Tariq

**Best for:** Venues that might not be aware of regulations or recently opened.

---

## Part 4: Follow-Up Sequence

Send these as replies to your original email (same thread).

### Follow-Up 1 (3-4 days after initial email)

**Subject:** RE: [Original Subject]

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Just floating this back up - happy to send a free sample pack if you'd like to try our bamboo straws.
>
> No pressure either way.
>
> Tariq

---

### Follow-Up 2 (7 days after initial email)

**Subject:** Still interested?

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I'll keep this short - if soggy paper straws are frustrating your customers, our bamboo alternative might be worth a look.
>
> Here's a 30-second video showing the difference: [link]
>
> Let me know if you'd like samples.
>
> Tariq

**Note:** Create a short video comparing paper vs bamboo straws in water.

---

### Follow-Up 3: The Breakup Email (14 days after initial email)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

> Hi [First Name],
>
> I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing the timing isn't right.
>
> No worries at all - I'll stop reaching out. If you ever need eco-friendly supplies down the line, just reply to this thread.
>
> All the best,
> Tariq

**Why this works:** The "breakup" email often gets the highest response rate. It triggers loss aversion and removes pressure.

---

## Part 5: Personalisation Tokens

For each email, customise these fields:

| Token | Example | Where to Find |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `[First Name]` | Laurent | LinkedIn, venue website |
| `[Venue Name]` | The Olive Branch | Google Maps, their website |
| `[Local Area]` | Manchester | Their address |
| `[Specific Detail]` | "your rooftop bar" | Instagram, Google reviews |

Even one specific detail dramatically increases response rates.

### Examples of Good Personalisation

- "I noticed you recently opened a second location..."
- "Saw your cocktail menu features a lot of highballs..."
- "Your sustainability page mentions reducing plastic..."

---

## Part 6: A/B Testing Strategy

Test one variable at a time to learn what works best.

| Week | Test | What You're Measuring |
|------|------|----------------------|
| 1-2 | Version A vs B | Open rate + reply rate |
| 3-4 | Winner vs C | Is shorter better? |
| 5+ | Winner vs D | Does regulation angle work? |

**Sample size:** Send at least 50 emails per variation before drawing conclusions.

### What to Track

- **Open rate** → How good is your subject line?
- **Reply rate** → How good is your email body?
- **Sample request rate** → How good is your CTA?

---

## Part 7: Quick Wins

### Timing
- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best times:** 9am - 11am
- **Avoid:** Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, weekends

### Format
- **Use plain text** - HTML templates feel like marketing; plain text feels personal
- **No attachments on first email** - Link to online resources instead
- **Keep paragraphs short** - 1-2 sentences max per paragraph

### Subject Lines That Work
- Questions: "Quick question about your straws"
- Curiosity: "What [area] bars are switching to"
- Direct: "Free straw samples for [Venue Name]"
- Problem-focused: "The soggy straw problem"

### Subject Lines to Avoid
- ALL CAPS
- Excessive punctuation!!!
- Clickbait that doesn't match the email
- Generic: "Great opportunity" or "Partnership proposal"

### The Power of PS
People always read the PS. Use it:
> PS - The samples are on us, no strings attached.

### Tools to Consider
- **Mailchimp** - Email tracking, templates
- **Lemlist** - Cold email automation
- **Apollo** - Finding contact details + sending
- **Hunter.io** - Finding email addresses

## Part 8: Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Do This Instead |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Sending the same email to everyone | Feels spammy, low response | Personalise each one |
| Giving up after one email | Most responses come from follow-ups | Send 3-4 follow-ups |
| Writing long emails | People don't read them | Keep under 100 words |
| Multiple CTAs | Confuses the reader | One clear ask |
| Talking about yourself | They don't care about you | Focus on their problems |
| Attaching files | Triggers spam filters | Link to online content |
| Using "Dear Sir/Madam" | Impersonal and outdated | Use first name |
| Sending from noreply@ | Can't reply even if they want to | Use personal email |

---

## Part 9: Tracking Your Results

Keep a simple spreadsheet:

| Date | Venue | Email | Version | Opened? | Replied? | Sample Sent? | Order? |
|------|-------|-------|---------|---------|----------|--------------|--------|
| 15/01 | The Crown | john@crown.com | A | Yes | Yes | Yes | Pending |
| 15/01 | Bar 42 | sarah@bar42.com | A | Yes | No | - | - |
| 16/01 | Olive Branch | mike@olive.com | B | No | - | - | - |

This helps you:
- See which versions work best
- Know when to follow up
- Track your pipeline

---

## Summary: The Perfect Cold Email

```
Subject: [Curiosity-inducing, relevant to them]

**Total length:** 3-5 sentences, under 100 words.
