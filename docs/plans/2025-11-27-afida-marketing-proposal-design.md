# Afida Marketing Partnership Proposal - Design Document

**Date:** 2025-11-27
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Laurent Curau

---

## Executive Summary

A performance-based marketing partnership where Laurent takes full ownership of Afida's digital marketing (paid ads, SEO, content, email campaigns, conversion optimization) in exchange for a **50/50 profit share** on customers acquired during their first 12 months.

Using agreed fixed margins (straws at 80%, other products at 25%), this translates to:
- **40% of straw revenue** (50% × 80% margin)
- **12.5% of other product revenue** (50% × 25% margin)

### Why This Structure

- **True partnership**: We split the profit 50/50 on customers I bring in
- **Time-limited**: Share applies only for first 12 months per customer - then they're 100% yours
- **Fully verifiable**: Fixed margins mean we only need revenue data (no COGS disputes)
- **Goals aligned**: I only earn when Afida earns
- **No fixed cost**: Afida pays nothing while e-commerce channel is unproven
- Reflects significant value provided (full-service agency + ongoing site maintenance)

### What Laurent Provides

- Digital advertising strategy and management (Google, Meta, etc.)
- SEO and organic content strategy
- Email marketing campaigns
- Landing page and conversion optimization
- Ongoing website development and maintenance
- Analytics setup and reporting

### What Afida Provides

- Ad spend budget (minimum £500/month)
- Product information, images, and inventory updates
- Access to business accounts (Google, Meta, Stripe)
- Timely responses on promotions and product questions

## Commercial Terms

### 50/50 Profit Share (Fixed Margins)

We split profit 50/50, calculated using contractually fixed margins:

| Product Category | Fixed Margin | Laurent's Share | Afida Keeps |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Straws** | 80% | **40% of revenue** (50% × 80%) | 40% gross margin |
| Other products | 25% | **12.5% of revenue** (50% × 25%) | 12.5% gross margin |

- **Payment:** Monthly, within 30 days of month close
- **Fixed margins:** Locked for 12 months, reviewed annually (protects both parties from disputes)
- **Rationale:** True 50/50 partnership on profit, using fixed margins for easy verification

### What Counts as "Attributed"

- Sales from customers acquired through digital channels managed by Laurent
- Includes: organic search, paid search, paid social, display ads, email campaigns
- Attribution window: customer's first touchpoint within 90 days of purchase

### What Doesn't Count

- Existing B2B customers (identified by email list imported before launch)
- Direct traffic from customers who already knew the brand
- Referrals from word-of-mouth or partners

### Customer Lifetime

- 50/50 profit share (40% straws / 12.5% other) on all purchases from customers acquired by Laurent
- For **12 months** from their first order
- After 12 months, customer becomes "house" customer (no further share - 100% to Afida)

### Example Calculation

> March results from acquired customers (within their first 12 months):
> - Straws revenue: £6,000 × 40% = £2,400
> - Other products: £2,000 × 12.5% = £250
> - **Laurent's total share: £2,650**
> Payment due: April 30th

### Customer Lifetime Value Example

> B2B customer acquired in January, orders quarterly for 3 years:
> - Year 1 (4 orders): £2,000 straw revenue → Laurent gets £800, Afida keeps £800
> - Years 2-3 (8 orders): £4,000 straw revenue → Laurent gets £0, Afida keeps £3,200
> - **Afida's total: £4,000** | **Laurent's total: £800**
> After 12 months, Afida keeps 100% of all future profit from that customer.

## Commitment & Termination

### Initial Term

- 6-month initial commitment from both parties
- Neither party can terminate during this period (except for breach)

### After Initial Term

- Auto-renews monthly
- Either party can terminate with 30 days written notice

### On Termination

Laurent will hand over:
- All ad account access (Google Ads, Meta, etc.)
- Analytics and tracking setup
- SEO documentation and keyword research
- Email lists and campaign templates
- Any other marketing assets created

### Annual Review

- At each 12-month anniversary, either party can request a terms review
- Opportunity to adjust percentage, scope, or structure based on results
- If no agreement reached, original terms continue until terminated

---

## Ad Spend & Budget

### Who Pays for Ads

- Afida pays ad platforms directly (Google, Meta, etc.)
- Laurent manages the campaigns and optimizes spend
- The profit share (40%/12.5%) is on revenue, not related to ad spend

### Budget

- £2,000-2,500/month ad spend
- Primarily allocated to straws (80% margin) for best ROAS
- Other products rely on SEO/organic (lower margin = harder to make paid ads work)

### Scaling Approach

- When trailing 30-day ROAS exceeds 2.0, Laurent will recommend increasing budget
- Scaling decisions are collaborative - Afida may have fulfillment or cash flow constraints
- No automatic scaling without agreement
- Can be raised as confidence and capacity grow

### ROAS Definition

> ROAS = Revenue Generated ÷ Ad Spend
> Example: £3,000 revenue from £1,000 ad spend = 3.0 ROAS
> ROAS > 1.0 means profitable (before share and other costs)

---

## Tracking & Measurement

### Setup Responsibility (Laurent)

- Google Analytics 4 with enhanced e-commerce tracking
- Google Tag Manager for event tracking
- UTM parameters on all paid campaign links
- Conversion tracking pixels (Google Ads, Meta, etc.)

### Transparency

- Afida gets full access to all analytics and ad accounts
- Monthly report shared by the 5th of each month showing:
  - Total e-commerce revenue
  - Revenue by channel (organic, paid search, paid social, etc.)
  - Customer acquisition count
  - Calculated share

### Reconciliation Process

1. Laurent sends monthly report with GA4 data
2. Afida has 5 business days to review/question
3. If discrepancy, resolve together using raw data
4. Payment due 30 days from month close

### Excluding Existing B2B Customers

- Before launch, Afida provides email list of existing B2B customers
- Orders from matching emails are excluded from attributed revenue
- List can be updated quarterly if needed

### Dispute Resolution

- GA4 is the source of truth for attribution
- If data is ambiguous, split the difference or exclude the transaction
- Keep the relationship more important than any single transaction

## Implementation Roadmap

### Before Launch (Week 1-2)

1. Afida confirms agreement to terms
2. Laurent gets access to Google, Meta, and Stripe accounts
3. Import existing B2B customer email list for exclusions
4. Set up GA4 with enhanced e-commerce tracking
5. Set up Google Tag Manager and conversion pixels
6. Establish baseline metrics

### Launch Phase (Month 1)

- Start with paid search (Google Ads) - fastest to show results
- Begin SEO audit and quick-win optimizations
- Set up email capture and welcome sequence
- First monthly report at end of month

### Growth Phase (Months 2-6)

- Expand to paid social if ROAS supports it
- Content creation for SEO
- Conversion rate optimization based on data
- Monthly reviews and scaling discussions

### Success Metrics at 6 Months

- Proven ROAS on paid channels
- Organic traffic growth visible
- Repeatable customer acquisition process
- Data to inform year-two strategy

## Anticipated Questions & Responses

### "50/50 seems like a lot - why should we split profit equally?"

> I'm bringing the customers to you. Without marketing, there's no e-commerce revenue. Plus I built and maintain the site for free, AND I'm managing all your digital marketing. The 50/50 split is only for the first 12 months - after that, every customer I bring you is 100% pure profit for Afida forever. Think of it as paying for customer acquisition from profits, not cash.

### "Why fixed margins instead of actual COGS?"

> Two reasons: (1) Simplicity - we only need revenue data from Stripe/GA4, no accounting debates. (2) Protection - neither party can game the calculation. If your actual margins change, we can adjust the fixed rates at the annual review.

### "40% of straw revenue seems high."

> It's 50% of 80% margin - so you're keeping 50% of the profit on those sales. And only for 12 months per customer. If I bring you a customer who orders quarterly for 3 years, you get 100% of years 2 and 3. If you hired agencies separately (£6-11k/month fixed), you'd pay regardless of results. With me, you pay nothing if I don't deliver.

### "What if e-commerce doesn't work for our business?"

> That's my risk to take. I'm betting my time that I can make it work. You're investing £2,000-2,500/month in ad spend - far less than agency retainers - and only paying me a share when there's revenue to share.

### "What if we want to hire someone in-house later?"

> After the initial 6 months, either of us can exit with 30 days notice. I'll hand over everything and help transition. No hard feelings.

### "Can we start with a lower percentage?"

> 50/50 is the fairest possible split - we're true partners. The 12-month cap already limits my take. And I'm providing full-service marketing AND I built and maintain the site for free. This is already performance-based with zero guaranteed income for me.

### "What about the site you already built?"

> That's a separate gift - I built it because I believe in what you're doing. This marketing arrangement is a new business relationship that stands on its own.
