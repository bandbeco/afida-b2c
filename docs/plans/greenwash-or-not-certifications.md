## CERTIFICATIONS & LOGOS

### 1. Seedling Logo (EN 13432)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** The Seedling logo proves a product is certified industrially compostable under European standard EN 13432, verified by TUV Austria.

**But...:** Only ~51% of UK councils collect food waste, and many of those don't accept compostable packaging. Your "compostable" cup likely ends up in landfill anyway.

---

### 2. OK Compost INDUSTRIAL

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Certified by TUV Austria to break down in industrial composting facilities at 55-60°C within 12 weeks.

**But...:** "Industrial" is the key word. Home compost bins don't reach these temperatures. If you put this in your garden compost, it will sit there for years.

**Source:** https://www.compliancegate.com/ok-compost/

---

### 3. OK Compost HOME

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** One of the few certifications that actually means what people think - this will break down in your garden compost heap.

**But...:** It's rare. Most "compostable" packaging you see is industrial-only. Always look for the specific "HOME" label, not just "OK Compost."

**Source:** https://www.compliancegate.com/ok-compost/

---

### 4. FSC Logo (Forest Stewardship Council)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** FSC means the paper/card came from responsibly managed forests. It's a legitimate certification for sustainable sourcing.

**But...:** FSC says nothing about what happens at end-of-life. An FSC-certified coffee cup with a plastic lining is NOT compostable or recyclable - it's just made from sustainable trees before becoming landfill.

**Source:** https://www.diamond-box.co.uk/news/what-is-the-carboard-recycling-process/

---

### 5. FSC 100%

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** All materials come from FSC-certified forests. This is the highest FSC tier for virgin material sourcing.

**But...:** Still only about sourcing, not disposal. A "100% FSC" takeaway box with a plastic window is still non-recyclable in most UK councils.

**Source:** https://anz.fsc.org/packaging

---

### 6. FSC Mix

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Contains a mixture of FSC-certified materials, recycled content, and "controlled wood." Legitimate but less strict than FSC 100%.

**But...:** "Controlled wood" means wood from non-certified sources that meets minimum standards - so "FSC Mix" can include forests that aren't actually certified.

**Source:** https://anz.fsc.org/packaging

---

### 7. FSC Recycled

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Made from 100% recycled content, verified by FSC chain of custody. The best FSC option for environmental impact.

**But...:** Recycled content doesn't guarantee recyclability. Check if the finished product can be recycled again in your area.

**Source:** https://anz.fsc.org/packaging

---

### 8. PEFC Logo

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Similar to FSC - certifies sustainable forest management. PEFC is actually the world's largest forest certification system.

**But...:** Like FSC, PEFC only covers where the material came from, not whether you can compost or recycle the final product. Don't confuse sustainable sourcing with sustainable disposal.

**Source:** https://lovepaper.org/sustainable-forest-management-and-certification-schemes/

---

### 9. Mobius Loop (Recycling Symbol)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** This symbol means the product CAN be recycled - somewhere, theoretically, in some facility.

**But...:** It doesn't mean your council will accept it. Only ~8.7% of plastic actually gets recycled. The Mobius Loop is technically accurate but practically misleading.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 10. Mobius Loop with Percentage (e.g., 30%)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** The percentage indicates recycled content - e.g., "30%" means 30% of the material came from recycled sources.

**But...:** The remaining 70% is virgin material. And recycled content doesn't mean recyclable - a product can be made FROM recycled material but not BE recyclable itself.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 11. Widely Recycled (Recycle Now)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Managed by WRAP/Recycle Now, this means 75%+ of UK councils can collect and process this material.

**But...:** That still means 25% of councils can't. Always check your local council's rules - "widely recycled" isn't the same as "recycled everywhere."

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 12. Check Local Recycling (Recycle Now)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Between 50-75% of UK councils can recycle this material. Honest about the uncertainty.

**But...:** In practice, most people won't check. This item probably ends up in general waste or contaminating recycling bins.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 13. Don't Recycle (Recycle Now)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Fewer than 50% of UK councils can process this. The honest answer is: bin it.

**But...:** Credit where due - this is refreshingly honest labelling. The problem is what the product is, not how it's labelled.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 14. Plastic Resin Code 1 (PET)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** PET (polyethylene terephthalate) is widely recycled in the UK. Drinks bottles are the classic example.

**But...:** The triangle with a number isn't a recycling promise - it's a material identifier. PET is recyclable, but not all PET products are collected everywhere.

**Source:** https://www.pack-supplies.co.uk/uk-food-packaging-symbols/

---

### 15. Plastic Resin Code 5 (PP)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Polypropylene (PP) is increasingly accepted - most councils now take PP tubs and trays.

**But...:** Black plastic PP is often invisible to recycling facility sensors and gets rejected. Same material, different colour, different fate.

**Source:** https://www.pack-supplies.co.uk/uk-food-packaging-symbols/

---

### 16. Plastic Resin Code 6 (PS)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Polystyrene (PS) is technically recyclable but almost never recycled in practice. Most UK councils don't accept it.

**But...:** The recycling triangle makes it look recyclable. It's not - in reality, polystyrene takeaway containers go to landfill.

**Source:** https://www.pack-supplies.co.uk/uk-food-packaging-symbols/

---

### 17. The Green Dot

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** This does NOT mean recyclable. It means the producer paid into a European packaging recovery scheme.

**But...:** One of the most misunderstood symbols. The Green Dot says nothing about whether YOU can recycle the product - only that the company paid a fee.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 18. Tidyman (Person Putting Litter in Bin)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** This is a reminder not to litter - nothing more. Created by Keep Britain Tidy.

**But...:** It's not a recycling symbol at all. It just means "put in a bin" - which could be landfill, recycling, or compost depending on the bin.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 19. DIN CERTCO Compostable

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** German certification body (like TUV Austria) that certifies to EN 13432. Equally valid as Seedling or OK Compost.

**But...:** Less commonly seen in UK than Seedling logo. Same industrial composting requirements apply.

**Source:** https://www.organics-recycling.org.uk/uploads/article1983/EN%2013432%20Compostable%20Products%20and%20Packaging.pdf

---

### 20. Certified B Corporation

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** B Corp certification means a company meets high standards for social and environmental performance overall.

**But...:** It's a company certification, not a product certification. A B Corp's packaging could still be non-recyclable plastic - the B Corp logo doesn't tell you about the specific product in your hand.

**Source:** https://www.bcorporation.net/

---

### 21. OK Biobased

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** TUV Austria certification verifying what percentage of a product comes from renewable biological sources (plants, not petroleum).

**But...:** Bio-based has NOTHING to do with biodegradability. A 100% bio-based plastic can be just as permanent as petroleum plastic. Source ≠ fate.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/ok-biobased

---

### 22. OK Marine Biodegradable

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** One of the toughest certifications - proves a product will biodegrade in seawater. Very few products achieve this.

**But...:** Extremely rare. If packaging has this, it's genuinely impressive. But don't confuse "biodegradable" claims with this specific marine certification.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/ok-marine-degradable

---

### 23. OK Soil Biodegradable

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Certified to break down in soil environments (like agricultural mulch films). Different from composting.

**But...:** Designed for products that stay in soil (farming), not for packaging you'd throw away. Rarely relevant to food service packaging.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/ok-soil-biodegradable

---

### 24. Cradle to Cradle (C2C)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** The gold standard for circular design. Products are designed to be completely recycled or composted back into raw materials.

**But...:** Rare and expensive to achieve. If you see C2C certification, the company has invested seriously in sustainable design - not just slapped a logo on.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/cradle-to-cradle-c2c-certification

---

### 25. EU Ecolabel

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Official EU certification for products with reduced environmental impact throughout their lifecycle. Rigorous and trustworthy.

**But...:** Post-Brexit, you'll see this less on UK products. It's still valid, but UK businesses may not pursue EU certification.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/ecolabel

---

### 26. Rainforest Alliance

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Certifies sustainable agriculture and forestry practices. The green frog logo is well-recognised.

**But...:** Like FSC, it's about sourcing, not disposal. Rainforest Alliance paper can still have a plastic lining that makes it non-recyclable.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/rainforest-alliance

---

### 27. RCS (Recycled Claim Standard)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Third-party verification of recycled content claims. If packaging says "50% recycled" with RCS, that percentage is audited.

**But...:** Only verifies recycled INPUT, not recyclability of the OUTPUT. A product can be verified 50% recycled but end up in landfill.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/rcs

---

### 28. ISO 14001

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** International standard for environmental management systems. Proves a company has processes to minimise environmental impact and comply with regulations.

**But...:** It's a company management certification, not a product certification. An ISO 14001 company can still sell non-recyclable products - the cert is about their processes, not what they make.

**Source:** https://www.gwp.co.uk/sustainable-packaging/accreditations/

---

### 29. EcoVadis Rating (Gold/Silver/Bronze)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Independent CSR rating covering environment, labour, ethics, and procurement. Gold = top 5% globally. Rigorous and credible.

**But...:** It's a company scorecard, not a product certification. A Gold-rated company can still sell products with poor end-of-life outcomes. The medal tells you about the company, not the packaging in your hand.

**Source:** https://www.gwp.co.uk/sustainable-packaging/accreditations/

---

### 30. Sedex Member

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Membership in ethical trade organisation focused on supply chain transparency, labour rights, and responsible sourcing.

**But...:** Like B Corp, it's company-level, not product-level. Being a Sedex member says nothing about whether the packaging is compostable, recyclable, or eco-friendly.

**Source:** https://www.gwp.co.uk/sustainable-packaging/accreditations/

---

### 31. BRCGS (BRC Packaging Materials)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** British Retail Consortium Global Standard for packaging safety and quality. Proves packaging meets food safety standards and won't contaminate products. Trusted by major UK retailers.

**But...:** It's about safety and hygiene, NOT environmental impact. BRCGS-certified packaging can still be non-recyclable plastic. The logo means "safe to use," not "safe for the planet."
