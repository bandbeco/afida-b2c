## CERTIFICATIONS & LOGOS

### 1. Seedling Logo (EN 13432)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** The Seedling logo proves a product is certified industrially compostable under European standard EN 13432, verified by TUV Austria.

**But...:** Only ~51% of UK councils collect food waste, and many of those don't accept compostable packaging. Your "compostable" cup likely ends up in landfill anyway.

**Source:** https://www.compostconnect.org/uk/compostable-certification-meaning/

---

### 2. OK Compost INDUSTRIAL

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Certified by TUV Austria to break down in industrial composting facilities at 55-60°C within 12 weeks.

**But...:** "Industrial" is the key word. Home compost bins don't reach these temperatures. If you put this in your garden compost, it will sit there for years.

**Source:** https://www.compliancegate.com/ok-compost/

---

### 3. OK Compost HOME

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** One of the few certifications that actually means what people think - this will break down in your garden compost heap.

**But...:** It's rare. Most "compostable" packaging you see is industrial-only. Always look for the specific "HOME" label, not just "OK Compost."

**Source:** https://www.compliancegate.com/ok-compost/

---

### 4. FSC Logo (Forest Stewardship Council)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** FSC means the paper/card came from responsibly managed forests. It's a legitimate certification for sustainable sourcing.

**But...:** FSC says nothing about what happens at end-of-life. An FSC-certified coffee cup with a plastic lining is NOT compostable or recyclable - it's just made from sustainable trees before becoming landfill.

**Source:** https://www.diamond-box.co.uk/news/what-is-the-carboard-recycling-process/

---

### 5. FSC 100%

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** All materials come from FSC-certified forests. This is the highest FSC tier for virgin material sourcing.

**But...:** Still only about sourcing, not disposal. A "100% FSC" takeaway box with a plastic window is still non-recyclable in most UK councils.

**Source:** https://anz.fsc.org/packaging

---

### 6. FSC Mix

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Contains a mixture of FSC-certified materials, recycled content, and "controlled wood." Legitimate but less strict than FSC 100%.

**But...:** "Controlled wood" means wood from non-certified sources that meets minimum standards - so "FSC Mix" can include forests that aren't actually certified.

**Source:** https://anz.fsc.org/packaging

---

### 7. FSC Recycled

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Made from 100% recycled content, verified by FSC chain of custody. The best FSC option for environmental impact.

**But...:** Recycled content doesn't guarantee recyclability. Check if the finished product can be recycled again in your area.

**Source:** https://anz.fsc.org/packaging

---

### 8. PEFC Logo

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Similar to FSC - certifies sustainable forest management. PEFC is actually the world's largest forest certification system.

**But...:** Like FSC, PEFC only covers where the material came from, not whether you can compost or recycle the final product. Don't confuse sustainable sourcing with sustainable disposal.

**Source:** https://lovepaper.org/sustainable-forest-management-and-certification-schemes/

---

### 9. Mobius Loop (Recycling Symbol)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** This symbol means the product CAN be recycled - somewhere, theoretically, in some facility.

**But...:** It doesn't mean your council will accept it. Only ~8.7% of plastic actually gets recycled. The Mobius Loop is technically accurate but practically misleading.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 10. Mobius Loop with Percentage (e.g., 30%)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** The percentage indicates recycled content - e.g., "30%" means 30% of the material came from recycled sources.

**But...:** The remaining 70% is virgin material. And recycled content doesn't mean recyclable - a product can be made FROM recycled material but not BE recyclable itself.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 11. Widely Recycled (Recycle Now)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Managed by WRAP/Recycle Now, this means 75%+ of UK councils can collect and process this material.

**But...:** That still means 25% of councils can't. Always check your local council's rules - "widely recycled" isn't the same as "recycled everywhere."

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 12. Check Local Recycling (Recycle Now)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Between 50-75% of UK councils can recycle this material. Honest about the uncertainty.

**But...:** In practice, most people won't check. This item probably ends up in general waste or contaminating recycling bins.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 13. Don't Recycle (Recycle Now)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Fewer than 50% of UK councils can process this. The honest answer is: bin it.

**But...:** Credit where due - this is refreshingly honest labelling. The problem is what the product is, not how it's labelled.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 14. Plastic Resin Code 1 (PET)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** PET (polyethylene terephthalate) is widely recycled in the UK. Drinks bottles are the classic example.

**But...:** The triangle with a number isn't a recycling promise - it's a material identifier. PET is recyclable, but not all PET products are collected everywhere.

**Source:** https://www.pack-supplies.co.uk/uk-food-packaging-symbols/

---

### 15. Plastic Resin Code 5 (PP)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Polypropylene (PP) is increasingly accepted - most councils now take PP tubs and trays.

**But...:** Black plastic PP is often invisible to recycling facility sensors and gets rejected. Same material, different colour, different fate.

**Source:** https://www.pack-supplies.co.uk/uk-food-packaging-symbols/

---

### 16. Plastic Resin Code 6 (PS)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Polystyrene (PS) is technically recyclable but almost never recycled in practice. Most UK councils don't accept it.

**But...:** The recycling triangle makes it look recyclable. It's not - in reality, polystyrene takeaway containers go to landfill.

**Source:** https://www.pack-supplies.co.uk/uk-food-packaging-symbols/

---

### 17. The Green Dot

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** This does NOT mean recyclable. It means the producer paid into a European packaging recovery scheme.

**But...:** One of the most misunderstood symbols. The Green Dot says nothing about whether YOU can recycle the product - only that the company paid a fee.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 18. Tidyman (Person Putting Litter in Bin)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** This is a reminder not to litter - nothing more. Created by Keep Britain Tidy.

**But...:** It's not a recycling symbol at all. It just means "put in a bin" - which could be landfill, recycling, or compost depending on the bin.

**Source:** https://www.recyclenow.com/how-to-recycle/recycling-symbols

---

### 19. DIN CERTCO Compostable

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** German certification body (like TUV Austria) that certifies to EN 13432. Equally valid as Seedling or OK Compost.

**But...:** Less commonly seen in UK than Seedling logo. Same industrial composting requirements apply.

**Source:** https://www.organics-recycling.org.uk/uploads/article1983/EN%2013432%20Compostable%20Products%20and%20Packaging.pdf

---

### 20. Certified B Corporation

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** B Corp certification means a company meets high standards for social and environmental performance overall.

**But...:** It's a company certification, not a product certification. A B Corp's packaging could still be non-recyclable plastic - the B Corp logo doesn't tell you about the specific product in your hand.

**Source:** https://www.bcorporation.net/

---

### 21. OK Biobased

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** TUV Austria certification verifying what percentage of a product comes from renewable biological sources (plants, not petroleum).

**But...:** Bio-based has NOTHING to do with biodegradability. A 100% bio-based plastic can be just as permanent as petroleum plastic. Source ≠ fate.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/ok-biobased

---

### 22. OK Marine Biodegradable

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** One of the toughest certifications - proves a product will biodegrade in seawater. Very few products achieve this.

**But...:** Extremely rare. If packaging has this, it's genuinely impressive. But don't confuse "biodegradable" claims with this specific marine certification.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/ok-marine-degradable

---

### 23. OK Soil Biodegradable

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Certified to break down in soil environments (like agricultural mulch films). Different from composting.

**But...:** Designed for products that stay in soil (farming), not for packaging you'd throw away. Rarely relevant to food service packaging.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/ok-soil-biodegradable

---

### 24. Cradle to Cradle (C2C)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** The gold standard for circular design. Products are designed to be completely recycled or composted back into raw materials.

**But...:** Rare and expensive to achieve. If you see C2C certification, the company has invested seriously in sustainable design - not just slapped a logo on.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/cradle-to-cradle-c2c-certification

---

### 25. EU Ecolabel

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Official EU certification for products with reduced environmental impact throughout their lifecycle. Rigorous and trustworthy.

**But...:** Post-Brexit, you'll see this less on UK products. It's still valid, but UK businesses may not pursue EU certification.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/ecolabel

---

### 26. Rainforest Alliance

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Certifies sustainable agriculture and forestry practices. The green frog logo is well-recognised.

**But...:** Like FSC, it's about sourcing, not disposal. Rainforest Alliance paper can still have a plastic lining that makes it non-recyclable.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/rainforest-alliance

---

### 27. RCS (Recycled Claim Standard)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** legit

**Truth:** Third-party verification of recycled content claims. If packaging says "50% recycled" with RCS, that percentage is audited.

**But...:** Only verifies recycled INPUT, not recyclability of the OUTPUT. A product can be verified 50% recycled but end up in landfill.

**Source:** https://www.groundedpackaging.co/certifications/rcs

---

### 28. ISO 14001

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** International standard for environmental management systems. Proves a company has processes to minimise environmental impact and comply with regulations.

**But...:** It's a company management certification, not a product certification. An ISO 14001 company can still sell non-recyclable products - the cert is about their processes, not what they make.

**Source:** https://www.gwp.co.uk/sustainable-packaging/accreditations/

---

### 29. EcoVadis Rating (Gold/Silver/Bronze)

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Independent CSR rating covering environment, labour, ethics, and procurement. Gold = top 5% globally. Rigorous and credible.

**But...:** It's a company scorecard, not a product certification. A Gold-rated company can still sell products with poor end-of-life outcomes. The medal tells you about the company, not the packaging in your hand.

**Source:** https://www.gwp.co.uk/sustainable-packaging/accreditations/

---

### 30. Sedex Member

**Type:** certification
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Membership in ethical trade organisation focused on supply chain transparency, labour rights, and responsible sourcing.

**But...:** Like B Corp, it's company-level, not product-level. Being a Sedex member says nothing about whether the packaging is compostable, recyclable, or eco-friendly.

**Source:** https://www.gwp.co.uk/sustainable-packaging/accreditations/

---

## MARKETING CLAIMS (Usually Greenwash)

### 31. "Biodegradable"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** There's no legal definition, no required timeframe, and no testing standard. A plastic bag is technically "biodegradable" - in 500 years.

**But...:** The Advertising Standards Authority has banned ads using "biodegradable" without proof of timeframe. Yet it's still everywhere on packaging.

**Source:** https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/environmental-claims-disposal.html

---

### 32. "Eco-Friendly"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Completely meaningless. There's no standard, no certification, no definition. Any product can claim to be "eco-friendly."

**But...:** The EU Greenwashing Directive now bans vague terms like "eco-friendly" without evidence. The UK hasn't followed yet, but it's coming.

**Source:** https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/green-claims-how-to-spot-greenwashing-atnH43T0Tp5c

---

### 33. "Environmentally Friendly"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Same as "eco-friendly" - no legal meaning whatsoever. Pure marketing.

**But...:** The CMA's Green Claims Code says claims must be substantiated. "Environmentally friendly" with no evidence is technically illegal - but rarely enforced.

**Source:** https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-claims-code-making-environmental-claims

---

### 34. "Natural"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Unregulated term. Crude oil is natural. Arsenic is natural. "Natural" says nothing about environmental impact.

**But...:** Studies show "natural" is one of the most persuasive environmental claims, despite meaning nothing.

**Source:** https://www.cruzfoam.com/post/exposing-greenwashing-tactics-in-sustainable-packaging/

---

### 35. "Plant-Based"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Describes what something is made FROM, not what happens when you throw it away. Plant-based plastic (PLA) often can't be composted or recycled.

**But...:** PLA needs industrial composting at 60°C for 90-180 days. In landfill, it behaves exactly like regular plastic. Plant origin doesn't equal planet-friendly disposal.

**Source:** https://www.packagingdive.com/news/polylactic-acid-pla-bioplastic-compostable-packaging/728875/

---

### 36. "Bio-Based"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Same problem as "plant-based" - it's about the source material, not end-of-life. Bio-based plastics often aren't biodegradable.

**But...:** Consumers consistently confuse "bio-based" with "biodegradable." They're completely different concepts.

**Source:** https://www.bioleaderpack.com/beyond-greenwashing-how-to-verify-truly-compostable-food-packaging-in-2025/

---

### 37. "Made from Recycled Materials"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Legitimate if true - using recycled inputs is genuinely better than virgin materials.

**But...:** Recycled content doesn't mean recyclable. A t-shirt made from recycled bottles can't itself be recycled. Check if the product closes the loop.

**Source:** https://www.awenconsulting.com/post/sustainable-packaging-explained-recyclable-vs-recycled-content-packaging

---

### 38. "Recyclable"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Technically accurate if ANY facility can process it. But that facility might not exist in your area.

**But...:** Only ~8.7% of plastic actually gets recycled. "Recyclable" describes potential, not reality. Check your council's accepted materials list.

**Source:** https://www.cueforgood.com/blog/is-recyclable-correct-term-to-describe-packaging/

---

### 39. "100% Recyclable"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Means every component can theoretically be recycled. More specific than just "recyclable."

**But...:** Coca-Cola and Nestle have been legally challenged over "100% recyclable" claims. The ASA ruled that bottles claiming "100% recycled" when only the bottle (not cap or label) was recycled were misleading.

**Source:** https://www.asa.org.uk/advice-online/environmental-claims-recycling.html

---

### 40. "Compostable" (No Logo)

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Without a certification logo (Seedling, OK Compost), this claim is unverified. Anyone can print "compostable" on their packaging.

**But...:** The ASA ruled that "compostable" on its own implies home compostable to consumers. Industrial-only products using this term are misleading.

**Source:** https://packagingeurope.com/news/misleading-compostability-claims-lead-to-ban-of-coffee-product-search-ads/12779.article

---

### 41. "Home Compostable" (No Certification)

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Without OK Compost HOME certification, there's no proof. Testing for home composting is specific and rigorous.

**But...:** In 2023, several European brands were fined for claiming "home compostable" without certification. Don't trust the words - look for the logo.

**Source:** https://www.bioleaderpack.com/beyond-greenwashing-how-to-verify-truly-compostable-food-packaging-in-2025/

---

### 42. "Oxo-Degradable" / "Oxo-Biodegradable"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** BANNED in the EU since 2021. These plastics don't biodegrade - they fragment into microplastics.

**But...:** Still legal in the UK post-Brexit, despite UK organisations calling for a ban. If you see this, avoid it completely.

**Source:** https://www.european-bioplastics.org/eu-takes-action-against-oxo-degradable-plastics/

---

### 43. "Carbon Neutral"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Usually means carbon emissions were "offset" by buying credits - not that the product doesn't produce emissions.

**But...:** The EU has banned carbon-neutral claims based on offsets. Apple, Danone, and JBS have all faced lawsuits over misleading carbon-neutral marketing.

**Source:** https://carbonneutralbritain.org/blogs/news/greenwashing-a-deep-dive-into-misleading-sustainability-claims

---

### 44. "Carbon Neutral Packaging"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Even worse - often only the packaging's carbon is offset, while the product inside (e.g., meat) is highly carbon-intensive.

**But...:** Amazon's "Climate Pledge Friendly" range included beef jerky - the most carbon-intensive food - labelled "climate-friendly" because some air was removed from packaging.

**Source:** https://changingmarkets.org/report/feeding-us-greenwash-an-analysis-of-misleading-claims-in-the-food-sector/

---

### 45. "Plastic-Free"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** May be technically true if no petroleum-based plastics are used.

**But...:** Bioplastics (PLA, PHA) are still plastics - just not petroleum-based. Straws marketed as "plastic-free" that are made from PLA are misleading. Bioplastic is still plastic.

**Source:** https://www.ecoenclose.com/bioplastic-is-not-plastic-free/

---

### 46. "Sustainable"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** One of the vaguest possible claims. No legal definition, no standard, no required evidence.

**But...:** The EU is banning unqualified "sustainable" claims. Companies will need to specify what makes something sustainable and provide evidence.

**Source:** https://www.insideenergyandenvironment.com/2025/12/the-european-commissions-new-green-claims-guidance-what-businesses-need-to-know/

---

### 47. "Green"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** greenwash

**Truth:** Means absolutely nothing. It's a colour, not an environmental standard.

**But...:** Putting a green leaf on packaging and calling it "green" is the original greenwashing tactic - and still works on consumers.

**Source:** https://blog.allpack.uk.com/packaging-greenwashing-keys-identifying-misleading-sustainability-claims

---

### 48. "Zero Waste"

**Type:** marketing_claim
**Verdict:** partial

**Truth:** Rarely accurate for a product. May be true for manufacturing process (zero waste to landfill) but not for the product itself.

**But...:** A "zero waste" packaged product still creates waste when the consumer disposes of it. The claim often only covers one part of the lifecycle.
