# Collection Image Generation Prompts

Prompts for generating collection images using AI image generation tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, Imagen, etc.).

---

## Part A: Industry Environment Photography (Recommended)

**Purpose**: Instantly identify an industry at a glance. Shows the business environment with human activity—NOT packaging products.

**Best for**: Mega-menu previews, collection hero images, marketing materials.

**Style**: Professional commercial/editorial photography, medium shot framing, warm and inviting.

### Platform-Specific Tips

**Midjourney**: Use prompts as-is with flags (`--ar 1:1 --style raw --v 6`)

**DALL-E 3**: Remove Midjourney flags, append: "photorealistic, 35mm photography, editorial style"

**Post-processing**: Generate at highest resolution, crop to 800×800px for retina (displays at 400px)

## Usage Notes

### Part A (Industry Environment)
- Square 1:1 aspect ratio for mega-menu previews (displays at 320×320px)
- Medium shot framing—not too wide, not too close
- Human activity adds warmth and authenticity
- NO packaging products shown—industry identification only

### Part B (Product Photography)
- "No text or logos" instruction prevents AI from generating fake branding
- Props (food items, drinks) add context without being the focus
- Lighting and surface choices match the mood of each business type
- Aspect ratio recommendation: 16:9 or 3:2 for hero images
