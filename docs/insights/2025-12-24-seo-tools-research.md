# SEO Tools Research Insights

**Date:** 2025-12-24
**Purpose:** Research into building free software tools for SEO/backlink acquisition

---

## Key Strategic Insight

**Free SEO tools should be designed for linkability, not search traffic.**

The common advice to "build free tools to rank for keywords" doesn't apply when:
- The tool-related keywords have near-zero search volume
- Your goal is backlinks, not direct traffic

Instead, design tools that journalists and bloggers will **cite and link to**.

## Ahrefs Keyword Research Findings

### Calculator/Tool Keywords (UK)

| Keyword | UK Volume | Verdict |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| packaging cost calculator | 30/mo | Almost no demand |
| party supplies calculator | 0/mo | No demand |
| catering calculator | 10/mo | Negligible |
| how many napkins per person | 0/mo | No UK demand |
| event supplies calculator | 0/mo | No demand |

**Conclusion:** UK users aren't searching for packaging/event calculators. Building these for SEO traffic would be wasted effort.

### Content Keywords with Actual Demand

| Keyword | UK Volume | Difficulty | Opportunity |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| eco friendly packaging | 1,500/mo | 22 | High volume, medium competition |
| takeaway packaging | 800/mo | 8 | Good volume, LOW difficulty |
| biodegradable meaning | 1,000/mo | 16 | Informational, low difficulty |
| what does biodegradable mean | 700/mo | 20 | Informational intent |
| sustainable packaging | 1,800/mo | 40 | High volume but harder |
| coffee cup sizes | 300/mo | 0 | Easy but lower volume |
| compostable | 700/mo | 11 | Moderate opportunity |

## Competitor Backlink Analysis

### What Earns Links in the Eco-Packaging Space

Analysed top-linked pages for Vegware, BioPak, and EcoEnclose:

| Site | Top-Linked Content | Referring Domains |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Vegware | Homepage | 1,415 |
| Vegware | /composting/ page | 120 |
| BioPak | Homepage | 1,070 |
| EcoEnclose | Homepage | 4,626 |
| EcoEnclose | Blog (entire section) | 189 |
| EcoEnclose | Individual blog posts | 1-2 each |

### Key Finding

**Blog content from packaging companies earns almost zero backlinks.**

Even EcoEnclose, which has an active blog, sees:
- Entire blog section: 189 referring domains total
- Individual posts: 1-2 links each

Standard content marketing is NOT working for link building in this space.

### What DOES Work

1. **Brand mentions** - Homepages dominate because sites link when mentioning "we use Vegware packaging"
2. **Being THE reference** - Vegware's composting page (120 links) works because it's the canonical resource for "how to compost Vegware products"

---

## Linkability Framework

### Factors That Make Content Linkable

1. **Citeability** - Would journalists reference this? ("According to [tool], the average...")
2. **Data uniqueness** - Does it generate novel insights that don't exist elsewhere?
3. **Shareability** - Would someone email this to a colleague?
4. **Embedability** - Can other sites embed a widget or badge?
5. **Reference value** - Is it something people bookmark and return to?
6. **Controversy/novelty** - Does it challenge assumptions?

### The Pattern for Success

Create something that becomes **THE cited reference** for a specific topic.

Examples:
- "UK Takeaway Packaging Disposal Guide" - cited in articles about disposal
- "Compostable Certification Checker" - cited when debunking greenwashing
- "UK Plastic Packaging Tax Calculator" - cited in business articles about the tax

## Competitive Landscape: Existing Tools

### Event/Party Calculators (Crowded)

- BusinessNES Dinnerware Calculator
- Napkins.com quantity guide
- Totally Promotional wedding napkin calculator
- Save The Food Guestimator
- Pickytarian Food & Drink Calculator

**Verdict:** Hard to differentiate. Many existing players.

### Cup Size Guides (Crowded)

- GMZ cup size guide
- Frozen Dessert Supplies guide
- YoonPak guide
- Multiple others

**Verdict:** Afida would be one of many.

### Compostable vs Biodegradable Guides (Crowded)

- Elevate Packaging
- GWP guide
- EcoEnclose blog posts
- Multiple others

**Verdict:** Crowded, but mostly static content. Interactive tool could differentiate.

### Packaging Cost Calculators (Less Crowded)

- PackMojo estimator
- Packaging Squad calculator

**Verdict:** Fewer competitors, but focus on custom printed packaging, not takeaway supplies.

## Recommended Strategy: "Greenwash or Not?"

Based on all research, the winning approach is:

### The Concept

An interactive tool that helps users identify misleading environmental claims on food packaging, combining:

1. **Viral game** - Tinder-style swipe (left=greenwash, right=legit)
2. **Educational reveals** - "But..." twists that surprise even correct answers
3. **Certification checker** - Searchable database for B2B users
4. **Citable report** - "The UK Greenwash Report" with statistics

### Why This Works

- **Game creates shareability** - "I got 7/10, can you beat me?"
- **Reveals create "aha moments"** - Shareable insights
- **Report creates citations** - Journalists quote the statistics
- **Checker creates utility** - B2B users (Afida's customers) find it useful

### Success Metrics (3-month targets)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Game plays | 5,000+ |
| Referring domains | 25+ |
| Press mentions | 5+ |
| Checker tool visits | 500+ |
