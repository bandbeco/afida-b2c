## Product-Level SEO Guidelines

### Product Name Rules
1. Keep names accurate and descriptive
2. Don't sacrifice accuracy for keywords
3. Remove jargon customers won't search for (e.g., "Tablin", "Airlaid" in names)
4. Use keywords in slugs and descriptions instead

### Product Slug Strategy
Include primary keyword + differentiator:
- `paper-coffee-cups-single-wall`
- `ripple-wall-paper-hot-cups`
- `kraft-pizza-boxes-12-inch`
- `biodegradable-paper-straws-black`

### Meta Title Formula
```
[Product Name] | [Key Feature/Size] | [Category] | Afida
```
Example: `Single Wall Paper Cups | 8oz | Disposable Coffee Cups | Afida`

### Meta Description Formula
```
[What it is]. [Key benefit]. [Sizes/options available]. [CTA with delivery mention].
```
Example: `Disposable single wall paper coffee cups for cafes and takeaway. Economical choice for high-volume service. Available in 4oz to 16oz. Free UK delivery over £100.`
