# Afida Designer Collaboration Campaign

*Strategic Brief*

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a designer collaboration programme for Afida. The initiative would see Afida commission designers to create exclusive artwork featured across two product tiers: eco-friendly packaging (cups, pizza boxes, ice cream containers, etc.) for hospitality businesses, and limited-edition signed art prints for collectors.

The packaging line becomes a permanent, reorderable product range — building ongoing revenue for Afida while contributing to environmental NGOs. The posters remain strictly limited edition, with 100% of proceeds going to charity.

This is positioned as both a **brand-building initiative** and a **sustainable business line**. The goal is to raise awareness, differentiate Afida in a commoditised market, support environmental causes, and create an ongoing revenue stream.

## Strategic Rationale

### Why This Works for Afida

The eco-friendly packaging market is largely undifferentiated. Suppliers compete on price, reliability, and range — but rarely on brand. A designer collaboration programme gives Afida a distinctive identity and creates recurring reasons to engage customers and press.

Unlike one-off campaigns, this model builds cumulative value: each new designer collaboration adds to the permanent product range, and businesses can reorder their favourite designs indefinitely.

### Why Partner with NGOs

Linking the programme to environmental charities strengthens the proposition:

- **Third-party amplification:** NGO partners promote each launch to their own audience, extending reach beyond Afida's existing channels.
- **Designer appeal:** Creatives are more likely to participate when the collaboration supports a cause.
- **Press angle:** "Designer collab raises £X for [NGO]" is a story; "packaging company releases new designs" is not.
- **Brand alignment:** Reinforces Afida's positioning as a purpose-driven company in the sustainability space.

## Target Customer

The designer packaging range is a premium tier for a specific segment of the market — not a replacement for standard packaging sales. Success depends on identifying and reaching the right businesses.

### Who This Is For

- **Independent cafés and restaurants that care about aesthetics** but cannot afford custom printing. Minimum order quantities for bespoke printed packaging typically start at 5,000+ units — prohibitive for small operators. Designer packaging offers a "designed" look without design costs or MOQ hurdles.

- **Values-driven businesses** where "supports ocean cleanup" or similar messaging resonates with their brand and their customers. These operators actively want to tell a story — the QR code and NGO link give them one.

- **Venues where customers see and hold the packaging** — sit-in cafés, dine-in pizzerias, gelaterias. The design gets noticed, potentially photographed, possibly shared. The packaging is part of the experience.

- **Businesses seeking differentiation in crowded markets** — a neighbourhood with five similar coffee shops, for example. Designer cups signal care and intentionality without requiring a full rebrand.

- **Operators who already stock eco-friendly packaging** and are willing to pay a modest premium for added value. They've already made the sustainability decision; this gives them something more.

### Who This Is Not For

- **Chains and franchises** — they have custom branding, established suppliers, and procurement processes that don't accommodate external design programmes.

- **Strictly price-sensitive operators** — for businesses where cost is the only consideration, plain unbranded packaging will always win.

- **Delivery-focused or grab-and-go operations** — where cups are sleeved, bagged, or otherwise invisible to the end customer. The design adds no value if no one sees it.

- **Businesses that already have custom-printed packaging** — they've invested in their own branding and won't swap it for third-party designs.

### The Value Proposition

For the target customer, designer packaging solves real problems:

- **Professional design without the cost or complexity.** They get distinctive, high-quality artwork without hiring a designer, managing print production, or committing to large minimum orders.

- **A story to tell.** The QR code, the artist, the cause — these give staff something to say and customers something to notice. It turns a disposable item into a small moment of connection.

- **Visible sustainability credentials.** The packaging signals environmental commitment without requiring explanation — the story is baked in.

- **Social media potential.** Distinctive packaging gets photographed. Customers share it. The business gets organic visibility.

### Market Sizing Implications

This is a niche within the broader market. The designer range will not replace standard packaging sales — it's a premium tier serving perhaps 5–15% of Afida's potential customer base. Pilot planning and inventory should reflect this: start with a focused group of aligned businesses rather than assuming broad adoption.

## Charter Partner Programme

Rather than launching to the general market and hoping the right customers find Afida, the recommended approach is to identify and recruit 20–50 target-fit businesses as charter partners *before* the first collaboration launches. These founding partners become the foundation the programme is built around.

### Use Them to Shape the Product

Before finalising the first collaboration, engage charter partners directly:

- What packaging formats do they actually use and in what volumes?
- What price premium is realistic for their business?
- Would they display a window sticker or counter card?
- Do they care more about the NGO angle or the design angle?
- What would make them excited to promote this to their customers?

Their answers inform product decisions, pricing, and marketing — replacing guesswork with direct input from the target market.

### Design the Launch Around Their Participation

The first drop isn't announced to the world with hopes that people will buy. Charter partners have already committed to stock it. This changes the launch dynamic:

- Day one, the product is already in venues — not sitting in a warehouse waiting for orders.
- Launch photography shows the packaging in real cafés, pizzerias, and gelaterias — not studio mockups.
- Case studies and testimonials are ready from the start.
- The press story becomes "20 independent cafés across the UK are now serving coffee in [designer]'s cups" — not "we made some cups, please buy them."

### Let Them Be the Proof Point

Charter partners function as a built-in test market:

- Their reorder rates reveal whether the product works commercially.
- Their customers' reactions show whether the QR code gets scanned, whether people notice the design, whether it generates conversation.
- Their feedback identifies what to adjust for the next collaboration.
- Real data from real businesses replaces assumptions about what the market wants.

### Feature Them Prominently

Charter partners receive visibility in exchange for their early commitment:

- Logos featured on the Afida website's Designer Collection section.
- Venues included in launch photography and video content.
- Quotes and testimonials used in press materials.
- Window stickers or counter cards identifying them as founding partners.
- Recognition in the annual impact report.

This creates mutual benefit: charter partners get exposure and association with a design-forward initiative; Afida gets credibility and proof that real businesses are already participating. Prospective customers see operators like themselves already on board, lowering the barrier to trying the programme.

### Recruiting Charter Partners

Identify candidates through existing Afida customers who fit the target profile, referrals from the designer or NGO partner's networks, and direct outreach to independent hospitality businesses with strong visual identities and sustainability positioning. The pitch: exclusive early access to a new programme, input into how it develops, and recognition as a founding partner.

## Designer Selection Criteria

The success of each collaboration depends heavily on selecting the right designer. The ideal collaborator combines a visual style suited to packaging, an engaged audience that overlaps with Afida's target market, and professional experience with commercial work.

### Style Requirements

The artwork must work on packaging — which imposes practical constraints:

- **Bold, graphic work with limited colours.** Printing on packaging has constraints. Designs with too many colours or subtle gradients may not reproduce well or may be cost-prohibitive.

- **Readable at small scale.** A cup is not a poster. Designs must remain legible and impactful when reduced to packaging dimensions.

- **Distinctive but not overwhelming.** The design should be recognisable and memorable without becoming visual noise that overwhelms the product.

- **Adaptable across formats.** The same artwork needs to work on cups, pizza boxes, and posters — different shapes, sizes, and proportions.

### Audience Alignment

The designer's following should overlap with Afida's target market:

- **Engaged following in food, hospitality, or sustainability spaces.** An audience of other illustrators won't drive packaging sales. Look for designers whose followers include café owners, foodies, and sustainability-minded consumers.

- **Follower count in the 10K–100K range.** Large enough to provide meaningful reach, small enough to be approachable and affordable. Micro-influencers often have higher engagement rates than major names.

- **Active promotion of collaborations.** Review their past work — do they actively promote commercial partnerships to their audience, or just post portfolio pieces? The former is far more valuable.

- **Connection to environmental themes.** Either in their work or stated values. This makes the NGO partnership feel authentic rather than bolted on.

### Professional Fit

Commercial illustration is different from fine art. Look for:

- **Experience with commercial work.** Licensing, deadlines, working to a brief, delivering files in appropriate formats — these are learned skills. Prior commercial experience reduces friction.

- **UK-based.** Simplifies logistics, time zones, and market relevance. A UK designer is more likely to understand UK hospitality culture and have connections that benefit the programme.

- **Responsive and professional communication.** The collaboration requires coordination on briefs, approvals, signing sessions for posters, and potentially press appearances. Professionalism matters.

### Red Flags to Avoid

- **Purely fine art practitioners.** Artists who don't do commercial work may struggle with briefs, deadlines, and the compromises inherent in packaging design.

- **Overly detailed or painterly styles.** Beautiful on a gallery wall, but may not reproduce well on packaging or may lose impact at small scale.

- **High follower counts with low engagement.** A sign of purchased followers. Look at likes, comments, and the quality of engagement rather than raw numbers.

- **No track record of promoting partnerships.** If past collaborations weren't shared with their audience, future ones probably won't be either.

### Where to Find Designers

- **UK illustration agencies.** Handsome Frank, IllustrationX, and Folio Art all represent commercial illustrators. They handle licensing, negotiations, and can recommend artists suited to packaging work.

- **Instagram hashtags.** Search #ukillustrator, #surfacepatterndesign, #packagingillustration, #ecofriendlydesign to discover independent artists.

- **Behance and Dribbble.** Filter by UK location and packaging/product design categories to find portfolios.

- **Association of Illustrators (AOI).** The UK professional body maintains a searchable directory of members.

- **NGO partner networks.** Ask the NGO who they've worked with before — environmental organisations often have existing relationships with aligned artists.

### UK Designers Worth Researching

The following names are starting points for research, not firm recommendations. Suitability depends on style fit, availability, and budget:

**Lisa Maltby** (Sheffield) — Food illustration specialist who writes about packaging illustration. Understands the commercial constraints.

**Janina Rossiter** — Environmental illustrator and author of children's books about ocean plastic. Has worked with sustainable brands and NGOs. Strong values alignment.

**Margaux Carpentier** (London) — Creates murals and bold illustrations, including work for cafés. Her style is graphic and would translate well to packaging.

**Rob Hodgson** (Bristol) — Playful style with a curiosity about materials and techniques. Experienced with commercial work for publishers and brands.

### Recommended Approach

For the first collaboration, consider briefing an illustration agency rather than approaching designers directly. The brief: "We're looking for UK-based illustrators with bold, graphic styles suitable for packaging, ideally with some connection to environmental themes or sustainability. Budget is £X for a commissioned piece with commercial licensing." The agency will return options, handle negotiations, and manage the relationship professionally.

## Product Strategy

Each collaboration features a single piece of commissioned artwork, adapted across two distinct product tiers targeting different buyer segments. The artwork, the cause, and the campaign are unified — but the products serve different purposes and follow different commercial models.

### Business Tier: Designer Packaging Range

A permanent, reorderable product line featuring designer artwork across Afida's packaging range.

- Products include: coffee cups, pizza boxes, ice cream cups, food containers, and other packaging formats
- Sold in cases/packs to cafés, restaurants, and hospitality businesses
- Priced at standard Afida margins
- Fixed contribution per unit donated to the associated NGO
- QR code linking to the campaign story and NGO
- Always available — businesses can reorder as needed

This model eliminates B2B friction. A café that loves a design can keep buying it. The product range grows with each new collaboration, and NGO contributions accumulate over time rather than ending when a "limited run" sells out.

### Collector Tier: Limited-Edition Signed Posters

The art object, designed to be displayed. This is where scarcity lives.

- Same artwork as the packaging, formatted as a high-quality print
- Signed and numbered by the designer
- Standard frame sizes for easy display
- Available unframed or framed at a premium
- Small print run (e.g., 50–100 units)
- Strictly limited — once sold out, no reruns
- **100% of proceeds go to the NGO partner**

The poster tier is the headline charity story. High margins on prints mean meaningful contributions to the NGO, while the "100% to charity" message is clean and compelling for press and social media.

### Why This Split Works

The two tiers reinforce each other. Someone sees a designer pizza box, looks up the collaboration, buys the poster. A collector shares their framed print on social media, a restaurant owner sees it and orders packaging. The artwork circulates in two worlds simultaneously — hospitality and design — multiplying reach.

The model is also sustainable. Afida builds a real product line with normal margins, NGOs receive ongoing contributions rather than one-off donations, and designers are properly compensated for their work.

## Commercial Model

### Designer Compensation

Designers are paid a commission fee upfront for their artwork. This is a professional engagement, not a request for free work.

- Afida pays a fixed fee for the artwork
- Afida owns the rights to use the artwork on packaging products
- Designer retains credit and gains exposure across UK hospitality
- The NGO contribution is a benefit of the partnership, not a substitute for payment

This approach eliminates potential tension around Afida profiting from "donated" work. The pitch to designers is clear: "We pay you to create artwork. It goes on packaging that funds our business and contributes to [NGO], and on limited-edition posters where 100% goes to charity. You get paid, you get exposure, and your work supports a cause."

### Revenue and Contribution Structure

**Packaging products:** Sold at standard Afida margins. A fixed amount per unit (e.g., £X per case) is donated to the associated NGO. This is transparent and easy to communicate: "Every case sold contributes to [cause]."

**Posters:** 100% of proceeds go to the NGO. Production costs are absorbed as a marketing expense. This is the headline charity story.

## Implementation Considerations

### NGO Partnership

Select NGOs whose mission connects directly to packaging, waste, or circular economy themes (e.g., ocean plastic, composting infrastructure). This creates a coherent narrative and makes the partnership feel authentic rather than generic. Each collaboration could be tied to a different NGO, or Afida could establish an ongoing relationship with a single partner.

### Launch Cadence

Each new designer collaboration is launched as a "drop" — an event with press, social content, and a limited-edition poster release. The packaging products then remain permanently available. Quarterly launches would provide enough frequency to build momentum while remaining operationally manageable.

### Website Requirements

The site should support:

- A dedicated "Designer Collection" section showcasing all collaborations
- Separate pages for each collaboration with the story, designer profile, and NGO partner
- Business ordering for packaging products (always available)
- Collector purchasing for posters (with sold-out states for past editions)
- Email capture for "notify me of next launch"
- Live or updated NGO contribution totals
- Landing pages linked via QR codes on packaging

### Content Strategy

Each launch generates content opportunities. Plan capture for:

- Designer interviews and behind-the-scenes of the creative process
- Production footage showing how the packaging and posters are made
- Charter partners using the products in the wild
- Collectors displaying their framed posters
- Impact updates from NGO partners

## Recommended Enhancements

The following additions would strengthen the programme:

1. **Theme each collaboration around a specific environmental issue.** Rather than generic "eco" designs, each collaboration could respond to a theme — ocean plastic, food waste, deforestation. The NGO partner rotates to match. This creates a series with narrative coherence.

2. **Add QR codes on all packaging linking to the story.** A simple landing page showing who designed it, what cause it supports, and cumulative contributions. Every piece of packaging becomes a touchpoint.

3. **Publish an annual impact report.** One well-designed page showing: designers involved, products sold, money raised, what each NGO achieved. Closes the loop, gives everyone something to share, and sets up the following year.

4. **Let NGOs or previous designers nominate the next collaborator.** Creates a chain and community, reduces curation burden, and makes each launch feel connected to the last.

## Success Metrics

Success should be measured across both brand-building and commercial dimensions:

- Designer packaging revenue as percentage of total Afida sales
- Reorder rate on designer products vs standard products
- Number of charter partners recruited and retained
- Total NGO contributions (packaging + posters)
- Email list growth
- Social media reach and engagement around launches
- Press coverage and backlinks
- QR code scans from packaging
- New B2B enquiries attributable to the programme

## Conclusion

This programme represents an opportunity to build a distinctive, sustainable product line while genuinely contributing to environmental causes. The dual-tier approach — permanent designer packaging for businesses, limited-edition posters for collectors — balances commercial viability with charitable impact.

By paying designers fairly and structuring NGO contributions transparently, the model avoids the pitfalls of cause marketing that feels exploitative. Everyone benefits: designers get paid and promoted, NGOs receive ongoing support, businesses get unique products, and Afida builds brand equity in a commoditised market.

The target market is a niche — aesthetically-minded, values-driven independent operators — not the entire hospitality sector. Success depends on identifying and cultivating relationships with businesses that fit this profile, starting with the charter partner programme.

The recommendation is to recruit 20–30 charter partners, use their input to shape the first collaboration, and launch with them already on board. Measure response across both tiers, gather feedback, and expand from there.
