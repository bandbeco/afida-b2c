# AFIDA Competitive Analysis: UK Eco-Friendly Hospitality Packaging

**Prepared for:** Laurent / AFIDA  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Focus:** UK eco-friendly packaging suppliers serving the hospitality industry

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines AFIDA's UK competition across two distinct market segments:

1. **Bulk Eco-Packaging Suppliers** - High volume, lower margins, wide product range
2. **Premium Custom Branded Packaging** - Higher margins, design-focused, lower minimums

**Key Finding:** There's a clear gap in the market for a supplier that combines the eco-credentials and product range of bulk suppliers with the modern UX and customer experience of premium players like Brand Your.

**Note:** Analysis of kiyuro.com was not possible as the site blocks web crawlers (robots.txt). No relevant information about this company was found through search.

## What Competitors Do Well

### 1. Clear Value Propositions

**Best Examples:**
- Vegware: "Packaging made from plants"
- Green Man: "100% Compostable - Made from plants NOT plastic!"
- Brand Your: "Make Your Brand The Total Package"

**Takeaway:** Single, memorable taglines that communicate eco-credentials instantly.

### 2. Trust Signals & Social Proof

| Competitor | Trust Elements |
|------------|----------------|
| Packaging Environmental | Client logos (Neat Burger, Roasting Plant), detailed case studies |
| GM Packaging | Trustpilot reviews in header, BRCGS AA certification |
| Vegware | B Corp, ISO, Living Wage certifications |
| Enviropack | Uber Eats partnership badge |
| Brand Your | Instagram @handles with photos, "700+ UK hospitality companies" |

**Takeaway:** Real client testimonials with verifiable social handles are more compelling than anonymous quotes.

### 3. Free Samples

Every competitor offers free samples prominently:
- Green Man: "FREE SAMPLES" in persistent banner
- Enviropack: Dedicated samples request page
- Brand Your: "Free Sample Pack" in main navigation

**Takeaway:** Samples are table stakes - make this frictionless.

### 4. Navigation by Use Case

**GM Packaging - Industries:**
- Hospitals, Schools, Coffee Shops, Bakeries, Restaurants, Takeaways, Retail, Caterers

**Enviropack - Shop by Food:**
- Burgers, Fish & Chips, Pizza, Sushi, Salads, etc.

**Brand Your - Business Type Filters:**
- Coffee Shops, Desserts, Bakeries, Takeaway, Hotels, Restaurants, Pubs + Bars

**Takeaway:** Hospitality buyers think in terms of *what they serve*, not packaging types.

### 5. Volume Pricing Transparency

**Enviropack:**
```
1 case: £15.45
5+ cases: £13.99
```

**Brand Your:**
```
1,250 units: £0.184/unit
2,500 units: £0.141/unit - save 24%
5,000 units: £0.118/unit - save 36%
```

**Takeaway:** Show volume breaks and savings percentages inline - creates urgency to order more.

### 6. Cross-Selling

**Brand Your - "Complete your order with add-ons":**
- Cups → Greaseproof paper → Stickers → Bags

**Takeaway:** Suggest complementary products at checkout to boost AOV.

### 7. Custom Branding Services

All competitors promote custom printing as a premium service:
- Vegware: "Custom Print" with dedicated Creative specialists
- Packaging Environmental: "Bespoke Packaging" and "Branded Packaging" as primary nav items
- Brand Your: Entire business model built around customization

**Takeaway:** If offering customization, make it a primary navigation item.

### 8. Educational Content

**Vegware:** "Keen to Compost?" regional composting consultation  
**Packaging Environmental:** "How to Dispose" section explaining waste streams  
**Brand Your:** Blog with trends, tips, customer stories

**Takeaway:** Education about disposal/sustainability builds trust and differentiates.

## What Competitors Do Poorly

### 1. Visual Overwhelm / Poor Product Discovery

**Problems:**
- Green Man: 27+ categories on homepage with identical visual treatment
- Enviropack: Complex mega-menus difficult to parse
- GM Packaging: Homepage has too much competing content

**Opportunity:** Clean, curated navigation with visual hierarchy. Consider "most popular" or "starter kit" approach.

### 2. Inconsistent Photography

**Problems:**
- Mixed lifestyle shots with plain product photos
- Generic, uninspiring white background images
- Products not shown in context

**Opportunity:** Consistent, lifestyle-oriented photography showing products *in use* at hospitality venues.

### 3. Weak Mobile Experience

**Problems:**
- Excessively long pages on mobile (Green Man)
- Mega-menus that don't translate to mobile
- Heavy pages with slow loading

**Opportunity:** Mobile-first design - restaurant owners browse on phones.

### 4. Generic Sustainability Messaging

**Problems:**
- Everyone uses same language: "eco-friendly," "sustainable," "planet-positive"
- No brand personality or story differentiation
- Corporate tone, no human element

**Opportunity:** Tell AFIDA's story (family business, specific mission for UK hospitality). Personality wins.

### 5. No AOV-Boosting Strategies

**Missing Features:**
- Product bundling
- "Frequently bought together"
- Starter kits for specific business types
- Subscription/auto-replenishment options

**Opportunity:** Bundles, volume discounts, and curated kits (e.g., "Coffee Shop Essentials") could significantly boost AOV.

### 6. Poor Content Marketing

**Problems:**
- Thin, SEO-focused blog content
- Limited educational resources
- No thought leadership

**Opportunity:** Genuinely helpful content (UK regulations, cost calculators, comparison guides).

### 7. Weak Urgency/Conversion Elements

**Missing:**
- Stock level indicators
- "Order by X for next-day delivery" messaging
- Time-limited offers

**Opportunity:** Stock indicators, delivery countdown timers, time-limited promotions.

### 8. No Personalization

**Missing:**
- Quiz or recommendation engine
- Saved preferences
- Quick reorder functionality

**Opportunity:** Simple quiz ("What type of venue are you?") could improve conversion and make experience memorable.

### 9. Long Lead Times (Brand Your specific)

**Problem:** 5+ weeks for custom printed items, no rush option prominently displayed

**Opportunity:** If AFIDA can offer faster delivery (especially on unbranded items), this is a major differentiator.

## Brand Your: Deep Dive

Brand Your represents a different business model worth understanding:

### What Makes Them Different

| Aspect | Bulk Suppliers | Brand Your |
|--------|---------------|------------|

| **Minimums** | Often 500-1000+ cases | As low as 1,000-2,500 units |
| **Price per unit** | Lower (£0.04-0.08) | Higher (£0.12-0.25) |

| **Target customer** | Cost-conscious, volume buyers | Brand-conscious, experience-focused |

### Brand Your's Strengths

6. **Cross-Sell Add-Ons** - "Complete your order with..." on every product page
7. **Product Templates** - Downloadable design templates for each product
8. **Referral Program** - Word-of-mouth acquisition strategy

### Brand Your's Weaknesses

1. No instant checkout for standard/repeat orders
2. Long lead times (5+ weeks)
3. Limited product range (focused categories only)
4. Pricing requires clicks to discover
5. No visible reorder/account dashboard features
6. Sustainability messaging is buried
