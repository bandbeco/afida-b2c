| Conservative | £25,180 | £8,648 | £1,440 |
| **Moderate** | £47,000 | **£16,215** | **£2,700** |

## Year 1 Projection (With Organic Growth)

After 6 months, SEO should start contributing. Here's a year-1 projection (moderate scenario):

| Source | Monthly Revenue (Month 12) | Your Share |
|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| Paid ads (straws) | £12,000 | £4,800 (40%) |
| Organic search (straws) | £3,000 | £1,200 (40%) |
| Organic search (other) | £4,000 | £500 (12.5%) |
| Email/repeat (mixed) | £3,000 | ~£1,000 (blended) |
| **Total** | **£22,000** | **~£7,500** |

**Year 1 total (moderate):** ~£130,000 revenue → **~£44,000 your share**

**Important caveat:** This assumes all customers are still within their 12-month window. As customers age past 12 months, your share on their purchases drops to zero.

## Afida's Economics (Moderate Scenario, Month 6)

| | Straws | Other | Total |
|-|--------|-------|-------|
| Revenue | £8,600 | £2,200 | £10,800 |
| COGS (at margin) | £1,720 | £1,650 | £3,370 |
| Gross profit | £6,880 | £550 | £7,430 |
| Your 50% of profit | £3,440 | £275 | £3,715 |
| Afida's 50% of profit | £3,440 | £275 | £3,715 |
| Ad spend | £2,000 | £250 | £2,250 |
| **Net to Afida** | **£1,440** | **£25** | **£1,465** |

**Note:** True 50/50 split. Afida still profitable after ad spend. And after 12 months, those customers become 100% Afida's.

## Break-Even Analysis

### When do you earn more than a traditional agency fee?

If agencies cost £5,000-10,000/month, your 50% profit share equals that at:
- ~£12,500/month straw revenue (to earn £5,000)
- ~£25,000/month straw revenue (to earn £10,000)

### ROAS Break-Even for Afida

**For straws (80% margin, 50/50 split = 40% net to Afida):**
- £1 revenue = £0.40 gross profit to Afida
- Break-even ROAS = 1 / 0.40 = **2.5x**

**For other products (25% margin, 50/50 split = 12.5% net to Afida):**
- £1 revenue = £0.125 gross profit to Afida
- Break-even ROAS = 1 / 0.125 = **8x** (not viable for paid ads)

**Conclusion:** Focus paid ads on straws. Other products need organic/SEO only.

**The 12-month cap matters:** After customers age past 12 months, Afida's margin jumps to full 80%/25% - making the long-term economics very attractive.

## Comparison: 50/50 Profit Share vs Old 20%/12% Model

| Scenario | Old 20%/12% | New 50/50 (40%/12.5%) | Difference |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|------------|
| Conservative (6mo) | £4,622 | £8,648 | +£4,026 (+87%) |
| Moderate (6mo) | £8,648 | £16,215 | +£7,567 (+87%) |
| Optimistic (6mo) | £16,296 | £30,545 | +£14,249 (+87%) |

The 50/50 split nearly doubles your earnings because you're taking half the profit rather than 20-25% of it.

---

## Customer Lifetime Value: Why 12-Month Cap Works

**Example: B2B customer orders £500 of straws quarterly for 3 years**

| Period | Revenue | Your Share | Afida Keeps |
|--------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Year 1 (4 orders) | £2,000 | £800 (40%) | £800 (40%) |
| Years 2-3 (8 orders) | £4,000 | £0 | £3,200 (80%) |
| **Total** | **£6,000** | **£800** | **£4,000** |

Afida gets 5× your lifetime take on long-term customers. The 12-month cap makes the 50% share palatable.
