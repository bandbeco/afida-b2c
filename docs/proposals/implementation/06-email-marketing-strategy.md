# Email Marketing Strategy for Afida

**Purpose:** Build an owned audience that generates attributed revenue with zero ad spend
**Revenue Share:** 20% on straws, 12% on other products (same as other channels)
**Goal:** 2,000+ subscribers in Year 1, contributing £500-1,500/month in attributed revenue

---

## Why Email Matters for This Partnership

| Channel | Cost Per Conversion | You Control It? | Revenue Share |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------| --------------|
| Google Ads | £5-20 CPA | No (rented) | 20%/12% |
| SEO | Free (but slow) | Somewhat | 20%/12% |
| **Email** | **~Free** | **Yes (owned)** | **20%/12%** |

Email is the highest-margin channel: once you have a subscriber, reaching them costs nearly nothing.

### Core Principles

1. **Value First** - Every email should help the reader, not just sell
2. **Segment by Intent** - Sample requesters ≠ newsletter subscribers
3. **Timing Matters** - B2B buyers check email during work hours
4. **Mobile-Friendly** - 50%+ will read on mobile
5. **Clear Attribution** - Track which emails drive revenue

---

## Part 1: Email Capture

### Lead Magnets (Ranked by Value)

#### 1. Free Sample Request (PRIMARY)

**Why it works:**
- Straws and cups are tactile products - buyers want to feel quality
- Extremely high intent - only serious buyers request samples
- Natural conversation starter for sales follow-up
- Low cost to fulfill (£1-2 per sample pack)

**Form fields:**
- Business name (required)
- Contact name (required)
- Email (required)
- Phone (optional)
- Products interested in (checkboxes)
- Estimated monthly volume (dropdown)
- Delivery address (required)

**Where to promote:**
- Prominent button on all product pages
- Header announcement bar
- Dedicated landing page for ads

---

#### 2. Custom Quote Request (HIGH INTENT)

**Why it works:**
- Large orders need personalized pricing
- Shows serious purchase intent
- Creates sales conversation opportunity

**Form fields:**
- Business name
- Contact name
- Email
- Phone
- Products needed (text area)
- Estimated quantities
- Delivery location
- Timeline (when do they need it?)

**Where to promote:**
- Product pages (for bulk quantities)
- Dedicated "Trade" or "Wholesale" page
- Exit intent for visitors viewing multiple products

---

#### 3. Newsletter Signup (LOW FRICTION)

**Why it works:**
- Catches visitors not ready to buy yet
- Minimal commitment
- Builds long-term audience

**Form fields:**
- Email only
- Optional: Business type (cafe, restaurant, catering, events, other)

**Where to promote:**
- Footer (every page)
- Blog posts
- End of content pages

**Value proposition examples:**
- "Join 500+ UK hospitality businesses"
- "Get eco packaging tips, new products, and exclusive offers"
- "Monthly sustainability insights for hospitality"

---

#### 4. Gated Content (USE SPARINGLY)

Only gate content that provides genuine value not available elsewhere.

**Worth gating:**
- "UK Packaging Regulations 2024: What Hospitality Businesses Need to Know"
- "Case Study: How [Real Business] Reduced Packaging Costs 30%"
- "Paper vs PLA vs Bagasse: Independent Comparison Report"

**Not worth gating:**
- Generic "eco tips" PDF
- Price lists (already on website)
- Basic product guides

## Part 3: Broadcast Emails (One-Off Campaigns)

Beyond automated sequences, send regular broadcasts:

### Monthly Newsletter

**Frequency:** 2x per month
**Content mix:**
- 1 product feature or new arrival
- 1 piece of educational/valuable content
- 1 customer story or testimonial
- Current promotions (if any)

**Template structure:**
```

   [Short description]
   [CTA: Shop now]

   [Tip, guide, or insight]

   [Unsubscribe, contact info]
```

---

### Promotional Campaigns

**Occasions:**
- Seasonal (summer events, Christmas catering)
- Sales (Black Friday, clearance)
- New product launches
- Sustainability awareness days (Earth Day, etc.)

**Best practices:**
- Announce → Remind → Last chance (3-email sequence)
- Clear end date creates urgency
- Segment by past purchase behaviour

---

## Part 4: Segmentation

Not all subscribers are equal. Segment for relevance.

### Segments to Create

| Segment | Definition | Different Treatment |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Sample requesters** | Requested samples | Higher intent - faster follow-up |
| **Quote requesters** | Requested quote | Very high intent - sales follow-up |
| **Newsletter only** | Signed up but no purchase | Longer nurture needed |
| **First-time buyers** | One purchase | Post-purchase sequence, encourage second |
| **Repeat buyers** | 2+ purchases | VIP treatment, exclusive offers |
| **Lapsed** | No purchase 90+ days | Win-back sequence |
| **Straw buyers** | Purchased straws | Straw-focused content and offers |
| **High volume** | Large orders | White-glove service, account manager |

### Segmentation by Business Type

If captured, segment by business type:
- Cafes → Focus on cups and straws
- Restaurants → Focus on food containers
- Events → Focus on bulk and variety
- Catering → Focus on everything, volume pricing

---

## Part 5: Technical Implementation

### Option A: Email Service Provider (Recommended to Start)

**Recommended: Klaviyo or Mailchimp**

| Feature | Klaviyo | Mailchimp |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| E-commerce focus | Excellent | Good |
| Automation | Excellent | Good |
| Segmentation | Excellent | Good |
| Price (1,000 contacts) | ~£30/month | ~£15/month |
| Price (5,000 contacts) | ~£100/month | ~£60/month |

**Klaviyo advantages:**
- Built for e-commerce
- Better abandoned cart flows
- Revenue attribution built-in
- Predictive analytics

**Setup steps:**
1. Create account
2. Install tracking snippet on site
3. Connect to Stripe/order system
4. Build signup forms
5. Create sequences
6. Enable abandoned cart

---

### Option B: Built in Rails (Long-term)

Full control, no monthly fees, but more work.

**Stack:**
- Action Mailer for sending
- Sidekiq for queuing
- Custom models for subscribers, campaigns, sequences
- Tracking pixels for opens
- Link wrapping for clicks

**Database schema:**
```ruby
# email_subscribers - covered earlier

# email_campaigns
create_table :email_campaigns do |t|
  t.string :name
  t.string :subject
  t.text :body
  t.string :status  # draft, scheduled, sent
  t.datetime :scheduled_at
  t.datetime :sent_at
  t.integer :recipients_count
  t.integer :opens_count
  t.integer :clicks_count
  t.timestamps
end

# email_sends (individual sends)
create_table :email_sends do |t|
  t.references :email_subscriber
  t.references :email_campaign
  t.string :status  # pending, sent, opened, clicked, bounced
  t.datetime :sent_at
  t.datetime :opened_at
  t.datetime :clicked_at
  t.timestamps
end

# email_sequence_steps
create_table :email_sequence_steps do |t|
  t.string :sequence_name  # welcome, sample_followup, abandoned_cart
  t.integer :step_number
  t.integer :delay_days
  t.string :subject
  t.text :body
  t.boolean :active, default: true
  t.timestamps
end

# email_sequence_enrollments
create_table :email_sequence_enrollments do |t|
  t.references :email_subscriber
  t.string :sequence_name
  t.integer :current_step
  t.datetime :next_email_at
  t.string :status  # active, completed, paused
  t.timestamps
end
```

---

## Part 6: Attribution & Revenue Share

### Tracking Email-Attributed Revenue

Every email should include UTM parameters:

```
https://afida.com/products/paper-straws?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=welcome_sequence&utm_content=email_3
```

**UTM structure for email:**
- `utm_source`: `email`
- `utm_medium`: `email`
- `utm_campaign`: Sequence or campaign name
- `utm_content`: Specific email (optional)

### Attribution Window

- Customer clicks email link
- UTM params stored in session
- If they purchase within 7 days, order attributed to email

### Monthly Revenue Share Calculation

```sql
-- Email-attributed revenue
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN product_category = 'straws' THEN 'straws'
    ELSE 'other'
  END as category,
  SUM(total_amount) as revenue,
  CASE
    WHEN product_category = 'straws' THEN SUM(total_amount) * 0.20
    ELSE SUM(total_amount) * 0.12
  END as your_share
FROM orders
WHERE attribution_source = 'email'
  AND created_at >= '2025-01-01'
  AND created_at < '2025-02-01'
GROUP BY 1;
```
