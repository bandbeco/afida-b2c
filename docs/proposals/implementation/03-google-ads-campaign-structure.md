# Initial Google Ads Campaign Structure

**Purpose:** Launch framework for Afida's paid search advertising
**Budget:** £2,000-2,500/month
**Strategy:** Focus paid ads on high-margin products (straws ~80%), SEO for lower-margin products (~25%)
**Goal:** Profitable customer acquisition with sustainable margins

---

## Margin-Optimised Strategy

### Why Focus on Straws?

| Product | Margin | After 15% Share | Ad Viability |
|---------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Straws** | ~80% | ~65% | Excellent for paid ads |
| Cups, containers, etc. | ~25% | ~10% | SEO/organic focus |

Concentrating £2,000-2,500/month on straws allows aggressive bidding while maintaining healthy margins. Other products benefit from organic search and remarketing.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Straws search campaigns (priority)
- Straws shopping campaigns (priority)
- Brand search (all products)
- Focus on ROAS > 2.0

### Phase 2: Expansion (Months 3-4)
- Add paid social for straws
- Display remarketing (all products)
- Test Performance Max for straws

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 5-6)
- Increase budgets on winners
- Evaluate expanding to other high-margin products
- Build on SEO gains for other categories

## Why Search Before Social - Summary

| Factor | Google Search | Meta Ads |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Intent** | High (actively searching) | Low (interrupting scroll) |
| **Audience** | In-market buyers | Broad targeting |
| **B2B fit** | Excellent | Moderate |
| **Quick wins** | Yes | Takes longer to optimise |
| **Risk** | Lower | Higher |

**Recommendation:** Prove search works first (Months 1-2), then layer in remarketing (Month 3+), then test prospecting (Month 5+) only if ROAS supports it.
