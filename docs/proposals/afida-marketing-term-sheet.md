# Afida Digital Marketing Partnership
## Term Sheet

---

**Parties:** Laurent Curau ("Marketing Partner") and Afida Ltd ("Afida")

**Effective Date:** [To be agreed]

---

### The Deal

| | |
|-|-|
| **What I do** | Full ownership of Afida's digital marketing: paid ads, SEO, content, email, conversion optimization, plus ongoing website maintenance |
| **What I earn** | 50/50 profit share for first 12 months per customer (see below) |
| **What you pay** | Ad spend directly to platforms (Google, Meta, etc.) - £2,000-2,500/month |

### 50/50 Profit Share (Fixed Margins)

We split profit 50/50 on customers I acquire, using fixed margins:

| Product | Fixed Margin | My Share | You Keep |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Straws** | 80% | **40% of revenue** | 40% gross |
| Other products | 25% | **12.5% of revenue** | 12.5% gross |

**Why fixed margins?** Easy to verify (revenue only), no COGS disputes, fair to both sides.

**Why 12-month cap?** After year 1, that customer is 100% yours forever.

### Ad Strategy

| Product | Margin | Ad Focus |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Straws** | 80% | Priority for paid ads |
| Other products | 25% | SEO/organic focus |

### Phased Rollout

| Phase | Timeline | Channels | Budget Focus |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **1** | Months 1-2 | Google Search + Shopping | 100% search, prove Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) |
| **2** | Months 3-4 | + Remarketing | Add retargeting on Meta/Display |
| **3** | Months 5-6 | + Social prospecting | Test Meta if search ROAS strong |

Search first (high intent), social later (after proving results).

### Ad Budget

- You pay ad platforms directly, I manage
- Budget: £2,000-2,500/month
- Scaling: We discuss together based on ROAS performance
- Primarily allocated to straws (80% margin products)

---

### Tracking

- I set up Google Analytics 4 with full e-commerce tracking
- You get complete access to all data
- Monthly report by the 5th showing revenue and my share
- GA4/Stripe is source of truth (revenue only - no COGS needed)

---

### What's NOT Part of This Deal

- The website I already built - that was a gift, no strings attached
- This is a separate business arrangement

---

### Why This Works

**For Afida:**
- Zero fixed cost while e-commerce is unproven
- You only pay when you earn
- After 12 months, every customer I bring is 100% yours forever
- Full-service marketing without agency retainers

**For me:**
- True partnership - 50/50 split is fair
- Upside if I make this work
- Full control to execute properly
- Fair compensation for significant effort
