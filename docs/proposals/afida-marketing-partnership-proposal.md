# Digital Marketing Partnership Proposal

**Prepared for:** Afida Ltd
**Prepared by:** Laurent Curau
**Date:** November 2025

---

## Introduction

I'm proposing a true partnership to build and manage Afida's e-commerce marketing channel. Rather than charging fixed monthly fees, we'll split the profit 50/50 on customers I acquire - for their first 12 months only. After that, they become 100% yours.

This proposal covers paid advertising, search engine optimization, email marketing, and conversion optimization. I'll take full ownership of these channels while you focus on products, fulfillment, and growing the B2B side of the business.

## Commercial Terms

### 50/50 Profit Share

We split profit 50/50 on customers I acquire. To keep calculations simple and verifiable, we use **fixed margins** agreed upfront:

| Product Category | Fixed Margin | My Share | You Keep |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Straws** | 80% | **40% of revenue** | 40% gross margin |
| Other products | 25% | **12.5% of revenue** | 12.5% gross margin |

**Why fixed margins?** We only need revenue data (from Stripe/GA4) - no COGS debates, no accounting disputes. If actual margins change significantly, we can adjust the fixed rates at the annual review.

### Attribution Rules

**Included:**
- Customers who first arrived via organic search
- Customers acquired through paid advertising I manage
- Customers from email campaigns I create
- Any digital channel under my management

**Excluded:**
- Existing B2B customers (identified by email before launch)
- Direct traffic from prior brand awareness
- Referrals from partners or word-of-mouth

### Customer Lifetime

Profit share applies for **12 months** from each customer's first purchase. After 12 months, that customer becomes 100% yours - I receive no further share on their purchases, ever.

This rewards me for acquiring high-quality customers, while ensuring you benefit from long-term customer relationships.

### Payment Terms

- Calculated monthly based on the previous month's attributed revenue
- Report provided by the 5th of each month
- Payment due within 30 days of month close

## Your Investment

### Ad Spend

You pay advertising platforms directly (Google, Meta, etc.). I manage the campaigns and optimize for results.

- **Budget:** £2,000-2,500/month
- **Scaling:** Adjustments based on ROAS performance
- **Your control:** All major decisions are collaborative based on your capacity

### No Fixed Fees

There are no retainers, hourly rates, or setup fees. My only compensation is the profit share - if the e-commerce channel doesn't generate sales, I don't earn.

## Advertising Strategy

### Margin-Optimised Approach

Based on your product margins, I'll focus paid advertising where it delivers the best returns:

| Product Category | Gross Margin | Advertising Approach |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Straws** | ~80% | Priority for paid ads |
| Other products | ~25% | SEO and organic focus |

### Why This Works

**Straws at 80% margin (40% share = 50% of profit):**
- We each keep 40% of revenue as gross margin
- True 50/50 partnership on profit
- Plenty of room to bid aggressively on ads
- High ROAS potential

**Other products at 25% margin (12.5% share = 50% of profit):**
- Same fair 50/50 split
- Better suited to organic search (no ad cost)
- SEO takes longer but costs nothing per click
- Email marketing drives repeat purchases at no marginal cost

### Phased Rollout

Rather than launching all channels at once, I'll roll out in phases to prove results before expanding:

**Phase 1: Prove Search (Months 1-2)**

| Channel | Monthly Budget | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Straws - Google Search | £900-1,000 | Capture high-intent buyers |
| Straws - Shopping | £700-800 | Product visibility in search results |
| Brand Search | £100 | Capture branded queries |
| Remarketing | £100 | Retarget site visitors |

Focus: Establish baseline ROAS on search before expanding to other channels.

**Phase 2: Add Remarketing (Months 3-4)**

| Channel | Monthly Budget | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Straws - Google Search | £800-900 | Continue optimisation |
| Straws - Shopping | £600-700 | Continue optimisation |
| Brand Search | £100 | Maintain |
| **Remarketing (Meta + Display)** | £200-250 | Retarget across platforms |

Focus: Expand remarketing to Meta (Facebook/Instagram). These are warm audiences who already know Afida.

**Phase 3: Test Social Prospecting (Months 5-6)**

| Channel | Monthly Budget | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| Straws - Google Search | £700-800 | Maintain winners |
| Straws - Shopping | £500-600 | Maintain winners |
| Brand Search | £100 | Maintain |
| Remarketing | £150-200 | Maintain |
| **Meta Prospecting** | £250-350 | Test cold audiences |

Focus: Only if search ROAS is strong, test targeting hospitality business owners on Meta.

### Why Search Before Social?

For B2B wholesale products, **search captures existing demand** while **social creates demand**:

- A cafe owner searching "paper straws wholesale UK" is ready to buy
- The same person scrolling Instagram isn't thinking about straws

Social has its place (remarketing works well), but search should be the foundation.

### Social Media Platforms Evaluated

| Platform | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Google Search/Shopping** | Primary | High intent, B2B buyers search when they need products |
| **Meta (FB/Instagram)** | Remarketing + Test | Good for retargeting; can target business owners |
| **Google Display** | Remarketing | Cheap, wide reach for retargeting |
| **LinkedIn** | Not recommended | Too expensive for this product price point |
| **TikTok** | Not recommended | Wrong audience for B2B wholesale |

This approach maximises your return on ad spend while proving results at each stage before committing more budget.

## Timeline & Commitment

### Initial Term

**6 months** - enough time for paid campaigns to optimize and SEO to gain traction.

### After Initial Term

The agreement continues month-to-month. Either party can exit with 30 days written notice.

### On Termination

I will transfer all assets to you:
- Ad account access and ownership
- Analytics setup and historical data
- SEO documentation and research
- Email lists and templates
- Any other marketing materials created

### Annual Review

At each 12-month mark, either party can request a review of terms to ensure the arrangement remains fair as the business grows.

## Why This Structure Works

### For Afida

- **Zero risk while unproven** - No fixed costs until the channel generates revenue
- **True partnership** - 50/50 profit split means aligned incentives
- **Time-limited** - After 12 months, every customer I acquire is 100% yours forever
- **Full-service solution** - Marketing, SEO, email, and web development in one partnership
- **Flexibility** - Easy exit after initial period if it's not working

### For Me

- **Fair partnership** - 50/50 split on profit is equitable
- **Upside potential** - If I build something successful, I share in that success
- **Full ownership** - I can execute my strategy without committee decisions
- **Long-term relationship** - 12-month customer lifetime rewards sustainable growth

## Comparison to Alternatives

If you hired agencies for these services separately:

| Service | Typical Monthly Cost |
|---------|---------------------|
| PPC Agency | £2,000 - £4,000 |
| SEO Agency | £1,000 - £2,500 |
| Email Marketing | £500 - £1,500 |
| Web Development | £2,000 - £4,000 |
| **Total** | **£5,500 - £12,000/month** |

These would be fixed costs regardless of results. With this proposal, at £10,000/month in straw revenue, you'd pay £4,000 - but you've just earned £10,000 and you keep 40% as gross profit (£4,000). And after 12 months, those customers generate 100% profit for you.

## A Note on the Website

I built and continue to maintain the Afida e-commerce website. That work is a gift - I did it because I believe in what you're building and wanted to support family.

This marketing proposal is a separate business arrangement. The website has no strings attached regardless of whether we proceed with this partnership.

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal and let me know any questions
2. Discuss and agree on terms
3. I'll set up analytics tracking and get account access
4. We begin with paid search in month one
5. First performance report at end of month one

I'm excited about the potential here, let's go and eat the big boys' lunches.
